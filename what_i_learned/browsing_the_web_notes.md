# Browsing The Web

### What is _transpiring_ under the hood when we try to visit a website?

When we enter a website like, Google, for instance we are asking a question. The question (or request) “Who is this google.com fellow?” is being asked all the way to your ISP (Internet Service Provider).

This request then gets taken from your ISP to your DNS (Domain Name Servers) which Andrei describes as a phonebook that has the lists of all these URLS like Google, Facebook, etc. and has the addresses of them.

Once the IP address is extracted from the DNS, they will send back that information through the ISP which gets taken to the web browser.

When the web browser receives the IP address, it will send another request to the “Google” servers and they know where it is because they have that IP address. Anything that is connected to the internet has an IP address.

We can think of servers as computers. Servers are usually stored in basements or huge server farms and they have a piece of software that send you files when you request for them.

They’ll receive that request from the browser and feed you back the 3 main components that make up a basic website (which are text files): HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

And *voila* we’ve got access to the Google website!
