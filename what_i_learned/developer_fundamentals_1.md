# Developer Fundamentals I
Now that we know how the workings of requesting for a page work,   we can use this information to our advantage. As shown in the image above, we have three ways on how to make a performative, fast website.

* Location of Server
* How Many Trips
* Size Of Files

We’re going to take all of these with us as we go throughout the course.

# What does a developer do?
There are two different terms that we often come across in the development world. These terms are…

1. Front End Developer
2. Back End Developer
3. Full Stack Developer

To put it simply, a front-end developer is someone that builds up what we see on the website they work mostly with HTML, CSS, Javascript.

The back-end developer is a person that handles the servers and makes sure that when a browser communicates with it and sends requests, it will serve up those files to it. They also handle databasing like PostgreSQL.

And, obviously, if you combine a front-end developer and a back-end developer you get… *a full stack developer*.

# WWW vs. Internet
Tim Berners-Lee was the first web developer, he was the one who invented the world wide web in 1989. There is a *difference* between the world wide web and the internet.

[40 maps that explain the internet](https://www.vox.com/a/internet-maps) This link will show us the history of the Internet. It started as the ARPANET and started expanding as time went on. Back then, people needed to share documents with each other, and most of the time the computer back then was excruciatingly slow.

Tim had been working at CERN for the time to invent a common language that the computers can speak, an agreed upon protocol that all servers can work with.

You can think of it like this: your phone is the internet and Instagram is the world wide web which is essentially a decentralized application.

**How is Tim Berners-Lee the first web developer?** Well, he actually created the first browser and the first server and the first website! They still have a copy of it , it’s a website from 1991.

# HTML, CSS, Javascript
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)  is a way for us to write text on websites, they also include hyperlinks that can link to other parts of the website, or to other websites. There was a slight issue though, it wasn’t the prettiest thing to look at.

And so, around 1995-1996 two other languages came to fruition. These languages are CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and Javascript. CSS handled the visual side of things, to make websites look prettier and appealing to the users. Javascript makes websites more interactive and functional.
