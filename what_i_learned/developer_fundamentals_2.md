# Developer Fundamentals II

1. Internet Explorer
2. Google Chrome
3. Firefox
4. Safari

Each of those browsers are owned by a company, they’re all going to have to agree how they’re going to read the HTML, CSS, Javascript is.

Funnily enough, when the world wide web started there was a ‘browser war’ that was taking place, where each browser was doing its own thing and implementing different things. We still have that to this day to some extent, but we do have a governing body now that creates the standards for all web developers.

It is still a pain point for developers that we need to figure out whenever we send our files to web browser, it all looks the same. You’ll always encounter this problem, but you want to make sure that wherever your website gets rendered, *anybody can see your website*, and not only that, but we also have to make sure that our websites look good on small screens, big screens, etc.

# Developer History
In the early 2000s were built with technologies that we’ve come to familiarize ourselves with. We have HTML, CSS, Javascript, but we also had JQuery, and JQuery was a library that allowed Javascript to be written in a simple, clean way that allowed us not to worry about working with other browsers. It’s *outdated* though and it’s not used very often anymore. You’ll see it less and less in job postings.

On the back-end side of things they had the LAMP stack which stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. In those days, back-end devs used PHP to write files that allowed us to have logic on the servers.

Apache is a software that efficiently serves up files and PHP is a language that is still being used today and Facebook actually uses it, but that’s because their website is built in the early 2000s. However, it’s a very unpopular language in terms of growth and job opportunities. Then we also have MySQL which is still being used.
